# Planetmakers Platform


### The problem of current social media

Trust and reputation are key elements of the Planetmakers Platform, as they mark a significant difference between peopleâ€™s current experience of social media, in particular, but also exchange. We are unfortunately very used to social media in which there is a lot of conflict, a disturbing number of people deliberately cause trouble for others, perhaps through deliberate misinformation, perhaps through harrassment and threats. Many of the accounts on social media that are doing this are anonymous or untraceable to real people, and many are bots, not real people.

### What separates us from other social media

Gary Alexander, founder of the planet platform explains it like this:

> Probably the main feature of the Planetmakers Platform is that we are
> not offering just another discussion system and trading system, but
> are building in a relationship of trust, with that trust maintained by
> reputation.
